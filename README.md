# Catch-the-Falling-Objects

An embedded systems project designed by myself which takes user input from a keypad, and uses an LED for the display.  The game is programmed in C, and uses an ATMEGA micro controller.  Catch the Falling Objects is played on a breadboard which connects the display elements, as well as the user input devices to the microcontroller.
